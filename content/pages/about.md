## What
This site is a collection of all the tips and solutions that I've discovered while working with software and other tech both in my work and in my hobbies. The content is public but is not really carefully edited, beyond fixing obvious typos. My actual blog can be found at [Balaji's Blog](https://blog.balaji-dutt.name/).

This site is heavily inspired by [my friend Ashwin's](https://codeyarns.github.io/) [tech blog](https://codeyarns.github.io/tech/index.html) as well as [Nelson Minar's](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/) [Log](https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/).

## Why
As of May 2020, I'm getting started on learning a whole new set of software tools and technologies and wanted a way to share the things I'm learning along the way. One of the things I've been learning is [the tech](#how) that powers this blog! (How very meta.)

## How {#how}
The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
